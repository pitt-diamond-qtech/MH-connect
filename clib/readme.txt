Installation 

Before installation, make sure to backup any work you kept in previous
installation directories and uninstall any previous installations of MHLib.
The MHLib package can be distributed on CD/DVD, or via download.
The setup distribution file is setup.exe.
If you received the package via download it will be packed in a 
zip-file. Unzip that file and place the distribution setup file in a 
temporary disk folder. Start the installation by running setup.exe before
connecting the MultiHarp device.

The setup program will install the programming library including manual 
and programming demos. Note that the demos create output files and must 
have write access in the folder where you run them. This may not be the 
case in the default installation folder. If need be, please adjust the 
acces permissions or copy the demos to a suitable folder.

Before uninstalling the MHLib package, please backup your measurement data 
and custom programs.
From the start menu select:  PicoQuant - MultiHarp-MHLib vx.x  >  uninstall.
Alternatively you can use the Control Panel Wizard 'Add/Remove Programs'
(in some Windows versions this Wizard is called 'Software')
